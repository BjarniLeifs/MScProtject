# RAMES

## Getting started.

First we need to have node installed, you can find it here -> https://nodejs.org/en/

After installed node we need to install grunt and grunt-cli. 

Type in console 
* npm install grunt -g
* npm install grunt-cli -g

After installed the grunt and it's cli we need to install apidocjs

Type in console
* npm install apidoc -g

By now we should be done with dependancies and should be in the root directory. Now we need to 
install the project dependancies.

Type in cosole
* npm install

When npm install has finished we need to type in console 
* grunt

Now the project should be up and running. 

In the folder Readings you can find all information that is needed for this project, I suggest that you update it as needed. 

Remember to change the links for the database to your path or where it is.
